# lilymandarin-v1-web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peferron/lilymandarin-v1-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peferron/lilymandarin-v1-web) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/peferron/lilymandarin-v1-web/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/peferron/lilymandarin-v1-web?branch=master)

Web interface for [lilymandarin-v1.peferron.com](http://lilymandarin-v1.peferron.com) (used to run at [lilymandarin.com](http://lilymandarin.com)).

The best choice by far would have been to simply generate a static website. But I wanted to try something I didn't already know. So I picked [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and went ahead cheerfully to add my brick to the massive edifice of websites that really, *really* did not need to be built as a single-page app.

:bangbang: This project is no longer maintained.
