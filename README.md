# lilymandarin-web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peferron/lilymandarin-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peferron/lilymandarin-web) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/peferron/lilymandarin-web/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/peferron/lilymandarin-web?branch=master)

Web interface for [lilymandarin.com](http://lilymandarin.com).

The best choice by far would have been to simply generate a static website. But I wanted to try something I didn't already know. So I picked [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and went ahead cheerfully to add my brick to the massive edifice of websites that really, *really* did not need to be built as a single-page app.

The website is now mostly usable. The most glaring omissions are pagination and animations. These omissions will probably remain; now that we've relocated to the USA, lilymandarin.com isn't that useful anymore, and I'm not quite in love with Angular so I won't be updating it out of personal interest either.

If you want to play with some Chinese characters or songs, it's all yours, though.
